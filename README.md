# economics-and-game-theory-with-pygame
I use PyGame to visualize the interactions between users of different preferences (strategies) with additional effects to simulate a dynamic economy. Players are assumed to have rnadom movements and unaware of other players' actions.

This simulation also collects data by each player (preferences, number of trades, resources and currency for trading, time periods simulated, and so on.

Fixes required: profit calcuations, firm functionality, additional data collection
